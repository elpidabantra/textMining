# textMining
Counting patterns in text. 

An algorithm that is designed to take a bug.txt file and read a pattern in it, where each whitespace is considered as a "joker" character that can be replaced by any characters. Then it reads a landscape.txt file and it counts the bugs found in the landscape.
